Bitcoin Flips Gold is a single-page application built with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) on top of [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) that presents regularly updated analytics regarding the progress of Bitcoin's market cap overtaking gold's market cap.

## Data

This data is updated every 3 hours via a containerized scheduled task written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and hosted on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).
